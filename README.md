# JavaScript ES6+

This repository contains all the exercises, notes, and development I've done during the JavaScript ES6+ course provided by [Origamid.com](https://www.origamid.com/). The course is designed to teach JavaScript from basic to advanced levels, giving you a comprehensive understanding of the language, its main methods, and its syntax. Although the primary focus is on learning the language, the course mainly applies the concepts to web development through DOM manipulations and requests using the Fetch API.

## Main Topics Covered

- Objects
- Strings
- Arrays
- Promises
- Fetch API
- JavaScript Modules
- Regular Expressions (RegExp)
- Node Package Manager (NPM)
- Git
- Babel
- Webpack
